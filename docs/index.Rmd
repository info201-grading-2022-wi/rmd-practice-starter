```{r setup, include=FALSE}
source("analysis.R")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Covid Report
I write a paragraph here. I will highlight that the total number of US cases is `r total_cases`, and the total number of US deaths is `r total_deaths`. I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
